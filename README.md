- **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up so that I can buy products.
- **Login:** As a user I can login so I can buy products and check the products I've already bought.
- **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
- **Edit profile:** As a user I can edit my own profile.
